# Distributed Application

This is the course's repository page and contains
all course related material in raw form (e.g. `.md` files, `.tex` files).
The [companion website](https://ucleuvenlimburg.github.io/distributed-applications/)
contains a more user-friendly view of the same material (e.g. the `.pdf`s resulting
from compiling the `.tex` sources.)

## Required Software

* Start by [installing Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html).
* Make sure you have [Git](installed).
* Get an IDE for Elixir development. Suggestions:
  * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  * [Spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/)
  * [Vim](https://www.vim.org/)

## Setup Instructions

Clone the course repository.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/UCLeuvenLimburg/distributed-applications.git
```

Register as a watcher so that you're notified of updates to the repository.

* Go to [the repository's Github page](https://github.com/UCLeuvenLimburg/distributed-applications).
* In the top right corner, select Watch.

To update your local repository with the most recent changes:

```bash
git pull
```

## Correcting Errors

If you encounter what you believe is an error in the course material,
you can suggest changes to be made through the GitHub web interface:

* Browse to the file containing the error.
* Click the edit button (sporting a pencil icon).
* Make the necessary modifications.

Your suggestions will not be committed directly;
instead, they reach us in the form of a pull request, pending for review. Only
after we explicitly accept to incorporate your changes will the course material be updated.

Accepted corrections in material written by `fvogels`
might cause an increase in [cake points](https://ucleuvenlimburg.github.io/cakepoints/).

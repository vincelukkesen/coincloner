# Assignment

We've now got a "read-only" GenServer. Add a functionality that lets us add a room.

Make sure that it is possible to call `MyBuilding.add_room(ProximusBlokD, atom, capacity)` (with the necessary guards). Check that your room has been added with `MyBuilding.get_rooms_for_building(ProximusBlokD)`.

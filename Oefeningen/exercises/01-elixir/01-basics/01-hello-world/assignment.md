# Assignment

Write your first Elixir "Hello world" application.

Elixir works like Python or JavaScript: you can simply
dump a number of instructions in a file and run it.
An Elixir script has extension `.exs`, so
start off by creating a file `hello.exs`.

Next, you'll have to write code that outputs `Hello World!`.
We give you the following hints:

* The function to print strings to the console is named `puts` (from put string).
  It resides in the `IO` module, meaning `IO.puts` is the correct way to refer to the printing function.
* Strings are delimited by double quotes, e.g. `"foo"`. Do not use single quotes as they have a completely different meaning in Elixir.

To test your code, run it from the shell as follows:

```bash
$ elixir hello.exs
```

Should you really get stuck, taking a peek at `solution.exs` can help you out.
We *strongly* advise you to *always* take a look at the solution(s),
preferably after having solved the exercise yourself: they
might provide you with extra insights that will come in handy later.

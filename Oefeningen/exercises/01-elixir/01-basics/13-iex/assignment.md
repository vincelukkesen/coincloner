# Assignment

Elixir, like Python, has a shell in which you can interactively experiment.
You launch it as follows:

```bash
# Windows users, using Bash
$ iex --werl &

# Linux users
$ iex
```

The shell has a number of features that might help you in your Elixir related endeavors:

* Autocomplete: `String.[tab]` will list all members of the `String` module.
* Documentation: `h String.trim` shows you all information regarding the `trim` function.
* `c "filename.exs"` loads the source file.
* You can execute code from the shell, which is great for quick testing.
* `i` lets you inspect values in detail.

## Task

Launch the Elixir shell and play around for it, for at least a whole [moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_(time)).
